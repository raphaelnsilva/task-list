# Task List App Documentation

### Overview
Welcome to the Task List App documentation! This application allows users to add, edit, 
mark as done or undone, and delete tasks directly from the application. Developed with 
React on the frontend and Node.js on the backend, the app uses Axios for communication between the two.
